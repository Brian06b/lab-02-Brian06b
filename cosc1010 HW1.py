# Homework Question: 
#
# You are given a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a student and their scores
# in different subjects.
#
# Student Data:
students = [
 {"name": "Alice", "scores": {"Math": 85, "Science": 90, "English": 78}},
 {"name": "Bob", "scores": {"Math": 70, "Science": 88, "English": 82}},
 {"name": "Charlie", "scores": {"Math": 92, "Science": 81, "English": 89}},
 {"name": "David", "scores": {"Math": 60, "Science": 75, "English": 80}}
 ]

for student in students:
    name = student["name"]
    scores = student["scores"].values()
    average_score = sum(scores) / len(scores)
    print(f"{student["name"]}: {average_score:.2f} is their average score")

    student_averages = {
        "Alice":84.33,
        "Bob":80.00,
        "Charlie":84.33,
        "David":71.67
        }
print("The students with a higher average score than 80 are: ")
for key in student_averages.keys():
    if student_averages[key] > 80:
        print(key)
    
        
        
#Write a Python program that:
# 1. Calculates the average score for each student.
# 2. Stores these averages in a new dictionary where the studentâ€™s name is the key and their average score is the value.
# 3. Prints the names of students whose average score is greater than 80.
# Your task is to calculate the average scores for each student and print the names of students
# whose average score is greater than 80.
#Solution
